						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Accessibillity in design is important for those who have visual, speech, and auditory
								disabilities. It is important to consider accessibility starting from the beginning
								of designing. Color is important, but so is contract especially for visual accessibility.

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article is the section on contrast. Sometimes I think it
							is difficult to read things with a bad contrast ratio. I couldn't imagine how much worse
							and frustrating it could be for others. I like how they gave resources to find a good
							constrast ratio when designing.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> As designers, developers, and general tech people, we have the power
								to create a web weâ€™re all proud of: an inclusive web made for and
								consumable by all people. </p>
