        <p> Hello! I'm a second-year studying at University of California Berkeley, 
        and I'm originally from Cary, North Carolina. In my free time, I enjoy lifting at the
        gym, going on runs outside, and watching k-dramas.

        <li>  I learned to focus on studying the the design of the product in a different way.
            Instead of how solely the content of the product, I will try to focus on  the intent or hierarchy 
            which is something I never really did before.

        <li> I liked the topic of the article. I thought it was interesting and to the point.
        </li>
        <li> How does the design guide your focus? </li>
